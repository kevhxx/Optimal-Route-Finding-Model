# Optimal-Route-Finding-Model

This code defines a Python application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with various graph algorithms for shortest-path calculations. The application is built using tkinter, networkx, and PIL libraries, allowing users to visualize a graph (specifically, a subway or transportation network) and run algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s, A*, Floyd-Warshall, Yen's K Shortest Paths, and Bellman-Ford to compute optimal routes between selected nodes.
